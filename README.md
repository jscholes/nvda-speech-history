An updated version of the Clip Copy add-on, initially created by Tyler Spivey.

The add-on allows you to review the most recent 100 items spoken by NVDA, as well as copy the selected item to the clipboard.

By default, use Shift+F11 to move back through the history, Shift+F12 to move forwards and F12 on its own to copy the selected item.

These hotkeys can be updated from within the Speech category of NVDA's Input gestures dialog.
