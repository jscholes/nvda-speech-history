description = "This add-on allows you to review the most recent strings spoken by NVDA, by default using Shift+F11 and Shift+F12; as well as Control+Shift+F11 and Control+Shift+F12 for oldest/newest strings respectively.  Using Control+F11, you can change how the cursor should behave when items are added to the history; by default the cursor will focus on the newest item.  Additionally, you can copy the focused item to the clipboard by pressing F12, or press NVDA+Shift+F11 and NVDA+Shift+F12 to record and copy multiple incoming announcements to the clipboard.  Use the settings panel for the add-on to modify the maximum number of stored history entries, and decide whether whitespace should be trimmed from the start or end of text; alternatively, the cursor behavior can also be set within this dialog.  Use NVDA's Input Gestures dialog to change the supplied keystrokes."
