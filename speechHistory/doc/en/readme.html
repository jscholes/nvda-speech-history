<h2>Speech History not working</h2>
<p>Some addons that process speech such as phonetic punctuation block this addon from working; however there is an easy solution to get both working in some cases.<br>
By default, The folder location is "C:\Users\name\AppData\Roaming\nvda\addons\speechHistory".<br>
Simply rename the addon folder to something alphabetically above the addon that is blocking speech history. For example "customSpeechHistory" then "phoneticPunctuation". Restart NVDA to apply the change.<br>
That's all you have to do. However the folder name will revert after reinstalling/updating speech history, so you will have to do it each time the addon is updated.</p>
Note: if there is another addon blocking speech history, running from scratchpad will not work, even if those addons are disabled.</p>
<h2>inputGestures</h2>
<p>All keys can be configured in the input gestures dialog, under the speech category.<ul>
<li>F12: copy current history item to clipboard.</li>
<li>Shift+F11: previous history item.</li>
<li>Shift+F12: next history item.</li>
<li>Control+Shift+F11: first history item (oldest).</li>
<li>Control+Shift+F12: last history item (newest).</li>
<li>Control+F11: change where the cursor should move when NVDA speaks.<br>
By default the cursor will focus on the newest item.</li>
<li>NVDA+Shift+F11: start recording multiple announcements.</li>
<li>NVDA+Shift+F12: stop recording and copy the announcements to the clipboard. Entries are separated via a new line "\n" character.</li>
</ul></p>
<h2>Settings Panel</h2>
<p>NVDA menu> Preferences> Settings> Speech History.<ul>
<li>Maximum number of history entries (requires NVDA restart to take effect): default 500, maximum 5000.<br>
The maximum number of items the history will store. Items are added to the history until the max length is reached. From that point onwards, the older items are deleted to make room for the newer ones.<br>
For example, the maximum is 20. Item 1 will be deleted, item 2 will become item 1, item 20 will be 19, while item 20 is the newest item.</li>
<li>Trim whitespace from start/end: default yes.<br>
Whitespace is described as characters like tabs, spaces, and empty lines, most widely used in indentation and formatting.<br>
If there are any of these characters before/after the contents of the item, they will be removed in your clipboard entry.</li>
<li>When NVDA speaks, the cursor should: default move focus to the new item.<br>
This setting can also be changed using control f11. There are 3 options: <ol>
<li>Moving to the newest item will ensure the cursor is keeping up to date with what is happening so you do not need to scroll to the bottom.<br>
If you move your cursor to another position, it will automatically reset to the latest item when a new one is added.</li>
<li>Syncing focus with the current item is useful to keep the current context without having to scroll back constantly. When a new item is added, the cursor will move back one position.<br>
When the currently focused item becomes the last item in the history after the max length is reached for the first time, you will hear a beep to indicate that the currently focused item is about to be deleted. Once the cursor loses focus, it will stay at the oldest position until it is focused on a new item.</li>
<li>Keeping the cursor at the current index will not affect the focus at all. As items are added, the contents under the cursor will change, but the position will not.<br>
Keeping your cursor at the latest position with this option is the same as having the focus move to the newest item. Of course without having it reset whenever you move the cursor again.</li>
</ol></p>
